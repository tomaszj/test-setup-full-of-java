# Base Dropwizard service built using SBT

This is an absolutely bare-bones project setting up a Dropwizard service using .sbt build file. Released on MIT license.

Most interesting bit is of course the build.sbt file (yes, it's that short). IntelliJ is clever enough these days to import SBT projects itself, so there's no need for the sbt-idea plugin anymore.

Enjoy!
