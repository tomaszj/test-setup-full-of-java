# test-setup-full-of-java

Sample setup of two apps (frontend and backend) tested with snappy mock-based Selenium tests and API integration tests.

The aim of this proof-of-concept is how to build complex apps, where acceptance tests can still be quickly ran tested from 

# What's involved

* frontend application based on AngularJS and [LinemanJS](http://linemanjs.com/) with Angular template
* API built using DropWizard and Java
* Suite of acceptance Selenium tests that would be derived from potential User Stories and defects
